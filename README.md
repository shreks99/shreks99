# Hello, I'm Shrey Sinha

I'm a Computer Science Master's Student and an aspiring Software Developer!

üéì Pursuing my Master's in Computer Science with a focus on data structures and multi-threading at UC Riverside.

üíª I recently worked on a parallel Quicksort algorithm.

<!--üìö Enhancing my knowledge in Data Structures and Algorithms for future opportunities. -->
ü§ù Looking to collaborate on innovative tech projects and keen to learn new technologies.

üéØ 2024 Goals: Contribute to more real-time communication projects and master DSA.

‚ö° Fun fact:  I'm intrigued by WebRTC and its potential to revolutionize real-time communication by making peer-to-peer connections more efficient and reliable.
